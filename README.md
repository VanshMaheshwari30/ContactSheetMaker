# Building Contact Sheet
This Project shows how to make a contact sheet for digital photographers, and how one can take one image and create nine different variants based on the brightness of that image. In this project we are going to change the colors of the image, creating variations based on a single photo. There are many complex ways to change a photograph using variations, such as changing a black and white image to either "cool" variants, which have light purple and blues in them, or "warm" variants, which have touches of yellow and may look sepia toned. In this project, we'll be just changing the image one color channel at a time
